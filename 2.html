    <p>It is revealed in "Min and Marty" that Finn was born on Hub Island (one of the human-inhabited islands outside of The Land of Ooo) to his father Martin Mertens and his mother, Minerva Campbell. Having been a known con artist, Martin is confronted by an old foe and forced to flee the house with baby Finn while Minerva was at work. Martin brings Finn onto a raft, only to be attacked by the Guardian. Finn and Martin are separated as a result, with Finn being sent adrift towards Ooo and Martin disappearing.</p>
